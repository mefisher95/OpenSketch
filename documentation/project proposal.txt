Project Proposal: OpenSketch

The goal of this project is to create a widget or a tool that is 
essentially a simple and easy to use notepad or sketchbook. 

The user should be able to create various objects or pads of 
various sizes, that they can easily write on or draw. They 
should be able to upload images to be drawn on and save anything
drawn with the tool as an image file. All objects created by the
user should be persistant and be accessable at any point unless
specifically deleted by the user.
